# Mission Control — Operational Loop State

This is the **handoff ledger** for the `/loop` command (Mission Control Operational Loop),
which runs **every 2 hours**. It is SEPARATE from `LOOP_LOG.md` (evolve) and `BUGHUNT_LOG.md`
(bughunt) — do not cross-contaminate.

**Every run MUST:** read this file top-to-bottom first → run the `/loop` protocol
(HEALTH → ORCHESTRATION → PIPELINES → CLOSE GAPS → VERIFY) → then rewrite the sections
below. `## DONE` is append-only history; `## TO-DO` is rewritten each run for the next run;
`## OPERATIONAL STATUS` is the at-a-glance current-reality snapshot.

> **Architecture note (post-Hermes excision, commit `cd96b0e`):** Mission Control is now
> **Claude-native**. There is **NO gateway on :8642** anymore — `/api/mc/gateway` deliberately
> returns "No gateway under Claude". The loop.md spec's "Gateway :8642 health gate" is **stale**;
> :8642 being down is **expected and correct**, NOT a blocker. The bridge (:8767) talks to Claude
> directly. There is also **no in-process kanban dispatcher and no in-process cron scheduler** —
> the gateway used to host both. Task execution + scheduling now depend on Claude Code (chat /
> spawn / this loop) and external Claude routines / Windows Scheduled Tasks, not a daemon.

## OPERATIONAL STATUS  _(snapshot — refresh every run)_

_Last run: **2026-06-15 ~17:35** (Run #2 — built the cron scheduler engine)._

| Subsystem | State | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Bridge (:8767) | ✅ UP | `GET /api/ping` ok, uptime ~14.5h; claude CLI ok (v2.1.178), probe 147ms. **Holds pre-restart code** (run#1 reconcile + run#2 scheduler load on next restart). |
| Gateway (:8642) | ⚪ N/A by design | Excised with Hermes; `/api/mc/gateway` returns graceful-empty. NOT a blocker. |
| `npm run build` | ✅ PASS | tsc + vite, exit 0 (chunk-size warning only) |
| `npm run lint` | ✅ PASS | `npx eslint` on the 2 touched TS files = "No issues found"; only pre-existing `office/tower` churn remains (sibling-owned) |
| Kanban / orchestration | 🟡 steady board | todo 8 · ready 1 · done 10 · blocked 6 · triage 1. **No stale_claim** (run#1 zombie stayed reclaimed). 6 blocked now report `blocked_no_reason` (info). |
| Cron jobs | 🟡 EMPTY + engine ready | store `jobs: []`, but the **scheduler daemon is now built** (fires due jobs on restart). Seeding the 2 pipeline jobs is now safe-to-fire — see TO-DO #2. |
| Content pipeline | ✅ stores live | `/api/content/pipeline` → campaigns 22 · drafts 6 · calendar 31 (run#1); `.mc/data/` written |
| Modules in error state | none observed | build renders; cron modal shows the honest amber "scheduler unknown — bridge predates daemon" banner against the live (old) bridge |

---

## TO-DO  _(rewritten each run — priority order, enough detail to act with no rediscovery)_

1. **Restart the bridge to activate TWO built capabilities at once** (`npm run bridge`, or whatever
   launches the operator's bridge / desktop app). The live bridge still holds pre-restart code
   (confirmed: `POST /api/mc/kanban/reconcile` → 404, `GET /api/mc/cron` has no `scheduler` field).
   After restart, confirm **all** of:
   - `GET /api/mc/cron` → includes `"scheduler": {enabled:true, running:true, tick_seconds:30, …}`;
     Operations → ⏱ CRON modal banner flips from amber "scheduler unknown" to green **DAEMON LIVE**.
   - `POST /api/mc/kanban/reconcile` (run#1) → `{reclaimed,threshold_hours,message}`; Operations →
     ⚠ diagnostics → **⟳ RECONCILE STALE** button works (disabled at 0 stale, the current state).
   - To run the bridge *without* the scheduler: `MC_SCHEDULER_ENABLED=0` (tick override:
     `MC_CRON_TICK_SECONDS`, per-job timeout: `MC_CRON_JOB_TIMEOUT`).
2. **Seed sentinel(7:00 = `0 7 * * *`) + content-engine(7:30 = `30 7 * * *`) cron jobs.** This is now
   safe-to-fire (the scheduler engine exists and will actually run them on the local clock). **Two
   guards before seeding:** (a) supply the *correct* pipeline prompts (find them in loop.md / AGENTS.md
   / the existing run-on-demand paths — don't guess), and (b) **content-engine auto-posts to Buffer
   (outward-facing side effect)** — confirm with the operator before creating an auto-firing public-post
   job. Was NOT auto-seeded this run on purpose (standing config + external side effect with no operator
   present). Create via the working "+ SCHEDULE JOB" UI or `POST /api/mc/cron`.
3. **Unblock the 6 blocked research tasks (root cause: no web-access tool).** All 6 (5×`narratrix`,
   1×`default`) are DA-Agency research/content tasks stalled ~150–165h. Diagnostics now report
   `blocked_no_reason` (the web-access reason from BUGHUNT_LOG isn't on the event payload). Fix is
   **config, not code**: give research-capable agents a web plugin (`web-brave-free` /
   `BRAVE_SEARCH_API_KEY`), then unblock+reassign. Operator/config action — surface it, don't fake it.
4. **Route the 1 triage task.** `"Produce content: Watch One Operator Run a Whole Agency"` (unassigned).
   Next action: `POST /api/mc/tasks/{id}/specify` (Claude flesh-out → promote) then assign a content
   profile (`narratrix`/`scriptwright`). Left un-fired (runs a live Claude turn) — do when operator present.
5. **Next capability to BUILD:** auto-route for triage tasks (triage → specify → assign-by-skill verb,
   GAPS #3) or retry-exhaustion escalation (GAPS #4). One end-to-end per run.

---

## CAPABILITY GAPS  _(ranked by operator impact; ✅=built, →bughunt=broken-not-missing)_

1. ✅ **Stale-claim self-heal (BUILT this run).** Diagnostics *detected* `stale_claim` but there was
   no remediation verb — one dead agent could freeze the board forever (it did: a 160h zombie).
   Built `POST /api/mc/kanban/reconcile` → `reconcileKanban()` → `reconcileBoard()` store action →
   **⟳ RECONCILE STALE** button in the Operations diagnostics modal. Reclaims stale running claims
   back to `ready` with a recorded `reconciled` event.
2. ✅ **Cron scheduler engine (BUILT this run — was HIGHEST remaining).** Decision made: an **in-bridge
   daemon thread** (the bridge is the long-running process post-Hermes). `mc_scheduler.py` matches the
   UI's `cronSchedule.ts` semantics exactly (5-field Vixie cron + `@macros` + interval shorthand, local
   clock, DOM/DOW OR rule); `CronScheduler` in the bridge wakes every 30s, fires due jobs single-flight
   via `run_claude`, stamps the outcome. Honest liveness is surfaced in the cron modal. **Loads on next
   bridge restart** (TO-DO #1). Seeding the 2 pipeline jobs is now unblocked (TO-DO #2).
3. 🟡 **No auto-route for triage tasks.** Triage tasks sit until a human runs `/specify`. A
   "triage → specify → assign by skill-match" orchestration verb is missing.
4. 🟡 **No retry-exhaustion escalation.** `max_retries` exists on tasks but there is no path that
   escalates / notifies / reassigns when a task exhausts retries (the spec calls for it).
5. 🟡 **No web-access provisioning surface.** Research agents silently block on missing web tools;
   there is no UI/endpoint to see "which agents lack a web plugin" or to provision one. (Config gap,
   surfaced by the 6 blocked tasks.)
- → bughunt / NOT this loop: block-reason **display** in the task drawer already exists (built by
  bughunt, reads event payloads client-side); FAILED-vs-BLOCKED column reconciliation done by bughunt.
  Do not redo these.

## DONE  _(append-only — newest first; dated, with file:line + how verified)_

### 2026-06-15 — Run #2 (BUILT the cron scheduler engine) · branch `auto/loop-reconcile-20260615`

1. **HEALTH GATE green.** Bridge :8767 UP (`/api/ping` ok, uptime ~14.5h; `/api/mc/health` → claude CLI
   v2.1.178, probe 147ms). Gateway :8642 N/A by design. `npm run build` ✅ (exit 0); `npx eslint` on the
   2 touched TS files ✅ ("No issues found"). Confirmed the live bridge still runs **pre-restart** code:
   `POST /api/mc/kanban/reconcile` → 404, `GET /api/mc/cron` has no `scheduler` field — so both run#1's
   reconcile and run#2's scheduler load together on the next bridge restart (did NOT kill the operator's
   bridge; verified everything in-process instead).

2. **ORCHESTRATION steady.** Kanban: todo 8 · ready 1 · done 10 · blocked 6 · triage 1. **No stale_claim**
   (run#1's 160h zombie stayed reclaimed). The 6 blocked tasks now surface `blocked_no_reason` (info) via
   diagnostics; root cause is still web-access config (TO-DO #3). Triage task unchanged (TO-DO #4). Nothing
   silently broken; the actionable items need operator config / live Claude turns, documented not faked.

3. **BUILT: in-bridge cron scheduler — the missing post-Hermes daemon (this loop's signature increment),
   end-to-end & LIVE-backed.** The UI rendered next-fire countdowns and `cronSchedule.ts` even *claimed*
   "the mc daemon runs on this machine and fires on its local clock" — but **nothing fired due jobs**
   (the gateway used to). New capability across every layer:
   - `mc_scheduler.py` (NEW) — pure, testable schedule-matcher mirroring `cronSchedule.ts`: `parse_cron`
     (5-field Vixie + `@macros`, `_expand_field` for `*` `,` `-` `*/n`), `parse_interval_seconds`
     (`30m`/`every 2h`, s/m/h/d), `is_due(job, now)` (cron: current local minute matches AND not already
     fired this minute; interval: ≥1 period since `last_run`, unfired anchored at `created_at`; inactive/
     prompt-less/unparseable never fire), `due_jobs()`, `schedule_kind()`. Standard DOM/DOW OR rule + 7→0
     Sunday normalization. Built-in self-test (`python mc_scheduler.py`).
   - `mc_store.py:623-643` — `MCStore.record_cron_result(job_id, ok, detail, trigger)` stamps `last_run`
     (epoch), `last_status` (ok|error), `last_trigger` (schedule|manual), `last_detail` excerpt, `next_run`.
   - `mission-control-bridge.py` — `import mc_scheduler`; module-level `MC_SCHEDULER_ENABLED` (default on),
     `MC_CRON_TICK_SECONDS` (30), `MC_CRON_JOB_TIMEOUT` (600); `CronScheduler` daemon thread (`status()`,
     `_loop` every tick, `_fire` single-flight via `run_claude`, never dies on a bad tick) started in
     `lifespan`; `GET /api/mc/cron` now returns `scheduler` status; manual `POST /api/mc/cron/{id}/run`
     now records results via `record_cron_result`.
   - `src/lib/api.ts:85-118` — `McCronJob` gains `last_run/last_status/last_trigger/last_detail`; new
     `CronSchedulerStatus` type; `getMcCron()` return adds optional `scheduler`.
   - `src/pages/OperationsCenter.tsx` — `SchedulerStatusBar` (green **DAEMON LIVE · tick 30s** vs amber
     starting/disabled vs amber "bridge predates daemon" when the field is absent) at the top of the
     ⏱ CRON modal, plus a per-job ✓/⚠ last-fire badge with the outcome in its tooltip.
   **Verified:** `python -m py_compile` on all 3 Python files ✅; `mc_scheduler.py` self-test ✅
   (07:00/07:30 daily fire-once-per-minute, no double-fire same minute, interval anchored at created_at
   then re-anchored at last_run, `@hourly` macro, DOM/DOW OR rule on the real 2026-06-15 Mon-the-15th,
   guards for paused/no-prompt/garbage); **in-process integration test** on a throwaway store ✅ (seeded
   interval-due + daily-not-due → `due_jobs` picks exactly the interval job → `record_cron_result` stamps
   ok/schedule and re-anchors so it's no longer due → error path stamps `error`); `npm run build` ✅ +
   `npx eslint` ✅; **live Vite preview** (bridge up) ✅ — `GET /api/mc/cron` from the page returns no
   `scheduler` field (old bridge) and the modal correctly shows the amber **"SCHEDULER STATUS UNKNOWN —
   bridge predates the cron daemon"** banner (exact honest fallback), zero console errors.
   **Not verified:** the green DAEMON-LIVE path + an actual scheduled fire — needs the bridge restart
   (TO-DO #1); the preview screenshot tool timed out twice on the live animation widgets (DOM text +
   clean console stand in). `graphify update .` run after edits (1420 nodes / 2743 edges).

### 2026-06-15 — Run #1 (baseline + stale-claim self-heal) · branch `auto/loop-reconcile-20260615`

1. **Established baseline & corrected the stale gateway assumption.** Confirmed bridge :8767 healthy
   (`/api/ping`, `/api/mc/health` → claude CLI v2.1.178). Verified via the bridge source that the
   **gateway was excised** with Hermes — `/api/mc/gateway` (`mission-control-bridge.py:2621-2624`)
   returns "No gateway under Claude". Recorded the architecture note at the top of this file so future
   runs stop treating :8642-down as a red health gate. `npm run build` ✅ (exit 0), `npm run lint` ✅
   (exit 0; only pre-existing `office/tower` churn).

2. **BUILT: kanban stale-claim self-heal (this loop's signature increment), end-to-end & LIVE-backed.**
   The board had a **160h zombie `running` claim** (`t_f76cf250`, signalscraper) that the existing
   `stale_claim` diagnostic detected but offered no fix for. Added a self-heal verb across all layers:
   - `mc_store.py:401-447` — `MCStore.reconcile_board(threshold_seconds=None)`: reclaims running tasks
     older than the threshold (default `STALE_CLAIM_SECONDS`=2h) back to `ready`, clears `started_at`,
     records a `reconciled` event with reason+`stale_hours`; returns `{reclaimed, threshold_hours, message}`.
   - `mission-control-bridge.py:732-753` — `POST /api/mc/kanban/reconcile` (`ReconcilePayload.threshold_hours?`).
   - `src/lib/api.ts:293-308` — `reconcileKanban(thresholdHours?)` + `ReconcileResult` type.
   - `src/stores/useTaskStore.ts` — `reconcileBoard()` action (import L23, iface L83, impl ~L227)
     that reclaims then refreshes tasks/stats/diagnostics; returns count.
   - `src/pages/OperationsCenter.tsx` — **⟳ RECONCILE STALE (n)** button in the diagnostics modal
     (store destructure L59, state ~L65, button ~L279), disabled & honest when stale count is 0.
   **Verified:** `npm run build` ✅ (exit 0); `npx eslint` on the 3 touched TS files ✅ ("No issues
   found"); `python -m py_compile` on bridge+store ✅; **unit test of the real `reconcile_board`** on a
   throwaway temp store ✅ (fresh-running kept, 10h-stale→ready, blocked untouched, `reconciled` event
   with reason recorded, custom-threshold path reclaims fresh) — all assertions passed.
   **Not verified:** the LIVE endpoint + DOM click — the running bridge holds pre-edit code (not killed:
   it is the operator's process) and the button can't be exercised live until a bridge restart (TO-DO #1).
   JSX compiles (tsc), logic proven by the in-process test.

3. **ORCHESTRATION: unfroze the live board.** Reclaimed the 160h zombie via the existing live
   `POST /api/mc/tasks/t_f76cf250/reclaim` (no restart needed — that verb predates this run). After:
   `by_status` running 1→0, ready 0→1; `kanban/diagnostics` `stale_claim` count 1→0. The 6 blocked +
   1 triage tasks were left in place with documented next-actions (TO-DO #2/#3) — they need
   web-access config / a live Claude turn, not silent mutation.

4. **PIPELINES checked.** `/api/content/pipeline` live → campaigns 22 · drafts 6 · calendar 31;
   `.mc/data/` stores present and written (calendar.json, content-ideas.json, ai-digest.json,
   creators-feed.json 39K, etc.). Integration env keys are not visible from the loop shell (the bridge
   may load its own env) so not asserting them unconfigured — the proven gap is web-access for the
   research agents (CAPABILITY GAPS #5). `graphify update .` run after edits.
